# Machine Learning Part
## CNN.py
It is the file for running CNN models. The function runSentiment and runReason are used to training model.Use it in main function adn run python CNN.py

## LSTM.py
It is the file for running LSTM models.The function is similiar with CNN.py

## bayes.py
It is the file for running bayes classifier.The function with "run_*" are used to traning the models

## Final.py
Runnng final.py could show the accuracy of each model. Before runing this file,the CNN and LSTM models should be trained
It should have a folder named models.In models folder,it should have cnn,lstm folders

## warning
Before runing LSTM and CNN.py, a folder named models should be created
